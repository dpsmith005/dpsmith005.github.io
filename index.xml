      <description>Generate SCOM events that can be turned into alerts This post contains the details about the application I wrote to generate events in SCOM. This allows SCOM to receive events via the SDK and associate them with an object in SCOM. The supported object types are Node, Windows, and Unix. The command line parameters allow you to specify the event message along with other details. Hopefully this post will help you download the necessary files and begin to generate events in SCOM.</description>

      <description>I have been working in the technology field since 1986. I started when you programmed in C, not C++, C# or other object oriented languages. We wrote our own objects. Desktop computers had to be opened up to move jumper settings to configure the system. My first computer was a 286 with a 40 MB drive (that&amp;rsquo;s right Mega bytes)! The Desktops at the time had to add a special board that contained 2MB of RAM.</description>

      <description>To build my blog I decided to use Hugo and Github. This was after looking at different options and talking to my friend Dale @ vCROCS.info. This was his recommendation and how he built his blog site. Check out his post about Hugo
To begin with I downloaded the Hugo product and installed it on my Windows 10 laptop. I wanted to learn Hugo and build a web site before tackling Github.</description>
