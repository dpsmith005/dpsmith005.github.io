      <description>Generate SCOM events that can be turned into alerts This post contains the details about the application I wrote to generate events in SCOM. This allows SCOM to receive events via the SDK and associate them with an object in SCOM. The supported object types are Node, Windows, and Unix. The command line parameters allow you to specify the event message along with other details. Hopefully this post will help you download the necessary files and begin to generate events in SCOM.</description>
